# Intro
This is the original sourcecode from my live-coding session at the React [Native Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Hamburg-React-js-Meetup/events/234290419/) in Hamburg.

You can find a more complete version of the code at the [sanitized repository](https://github.com/AppWithUs/rnmeetup-25102016).


# Run the app
- Install all necessary React Native prerequesites
- Hit ```react-native run-ios``` in your console.
- Hit ```react-native run-android``` in your console.


# API Keys
I left the needed API keys in the sourcecode but I will not guarantee their usage. If I detect any misusage, I will invalidate them. But feel free to use them in an adequate way to test the application.
